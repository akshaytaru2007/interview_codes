## Async Await Questions answered by ChatGPT

> Can you explain `Async` and `Launch` in Coroutines?

### `Launch`
**Purpose**:<br>The launch function is used to start a new coroutine without blocking the current thread. It's used for fire-and-forget coroutine executions, where you don't need the result of the coroutine.
<br>

**Return Type:** <br>launch returns a Job object. This Job can be used to control the lifecycle of the coroutine (like cancellation), but it does not hold any result value.

**Behavior:** <br>When a coroutine is started using launch, it executes independently of the code that follows it. The code after the launch block continues to run immediately.
Example Use Case: launch is ideal for tasks where you want to execute something asynchronously and don't care about the result, such as updating a user interface or logging information.

### `Async`
**Purpose:**<br>The async function is used to start a new coroutine and eventually retrieve a result from it. It's designed for situations where you need to perform an operation that produces a result and you might want to wait for this result.
Return Type: async returns a Deferred object. A Deferred is a non-blocking future â€” it promises to provide a result later. You can await on a Deferred to get its result, which suspends the coroutine until the result is available, without blocking the thread.

**Behavior:** <br>The coroutine started with async runs separately from the main code, similar to launch. However, you have the option to await the result, which suspends the coroutine (in which await is called) until the result is available.
Example Use Case: async is useful when you need to perform some computation or IO operation and use the result in the future. For example, fetching data from a network and then processing it.

#### Key Differences
**Result Handling:** 
<br>The primary difference is that async is used when you need to get a result back from the coroutine (via Deferred), whereas launch is for when you don't need a result.

**Control Mechanisms:**
<ul>
<li>launch returns a Job, which can be used for cancellation or to check the status, whereas async returns Deferred, which additionally allows you to retrieve the result.
<li>Use of await: With async, you use await to get the result, suspending the coroutine until the result is ready. In contrast, launch does not have a mechanism to directly obtain a result.
</ul>
<ul>When to Use Each:
<li>Use launch for simple fire-and-forget operations, where you don't need to handle the result of the coroutine.
<li>Use async when you need the result of the operation, especially when dealing with computations or data fetching.</ul>
Remember, the choice between async and launch largely depends on whether you need the result of the coroutine and how you want to handle its execution and result.


> what about exception handling?

Exception handling in Kotlin coroutines, especially when comparing launch and async, has some important distinctions. Understanding how exceptions are handled in each case is crucial for writing robust and resilient asynchronous code.

### Exception Handling in launch
**Behavior:** <br>When an exception is thrown inside a coroutine started with launch, the default behavior is to propagate the exception to the parent coroutine's context. This typically leads to the cancellation of the parent coroutine and any of its children.

**Handling Exceptions:** <br>To handle exceptions within a launch coroutine, you can use a try-catch block inside the coroutine. This way, you can catch and handle exceptions specifically thrown within that coroutine.

**Uncaught Exceptions:** <br>If an exception is not caught inside the launch coroutine, it's considered an uncaught exception. The coroutine framework handles uncaught exceptions by passing them to the coroutine's CoroutineExceptionHandler, if specified, or by using the default handler of the coroutine's context.
### Exception Handling in async
**Behavior**: <br>With async, exceptions are handled differently. When an exception occurs in an async coroutine, it is captured and stored in the resulting Deferred object. This exception is not immediately thrown or propagated.

**Retrieving Exceptions:** <br>The stored exception is only thrown when the await() method is called on the Deferred object. If you never call await(), the exception remains encapsulated within the Deferred and is never propagated or handled.

**Handling Exceptions:** <br>To handle exceptions in an async coroutine, you can use a try-catch block around the await() call. This allows you to catch and handle exceptions that were thrown during the coroutine's execution.
### Key Differences in Exception Handling
**Propagation:** <br>In launch, exceptions can immediately propagate to the parent coroutine, potentially leading to its cancellation. In async, exceptions are contained within the Deferred object until await() is called.

**Handling Location:** <br>In launch, you typically handle exceptions inside the coroutine itself. In async, you often handle exceptions at the point where you call await() on the Deferred.

**Uncaught Exceptions:** <br>Uncaught exceptions in launch are dealt with by the coroutine's exception handler or context, while in async, they are stored and only revealed upon calling await().

>Why Use SupervisorScope?

In many cases, when working with multiple coroutines, you might want them to operate independently. If one coroutine fails, it shouldn't necessarily cause all others to fail. SupervisorScope allows each coroutine to handle its exceptions independently.

Example
Let's consider an example to illustrate how SupervisorScope works:

kotlin
Copy code
```import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    // This is the parent coroutine
    supervisorScope {
        // Child coroutine 1
            launch {
                try {
                    println("Child coroutine 1 is doing some work")
                    delay(1000)
                    println("Child coroutine 1 finished work")
                } catch (e: Exception) {
                    println("Exception in child coroutine 1: ${e.message}")
                }
            }
        }

        // Child coroutine 2
        launch {
            try {
                println("Child coroutine 2 is doing some work")
                throw RuntimeException("Something went wrong in coroutine 2")
            } catch (e: Exception) {
                println("Exception in child coroutine 2: ${e.message}")
            }
        }

        // Child coroutine 3
        launch {
            println("Child coroutine 3 is doing some work")
            delay(2000)
            println("Child coroutine 3 finished work")
        }
    }
    println("Back to main coroutine")
}
```
In this example:

We have a supervisorScope with three child coroutines.
<br>Each child coroutine is doing some work.
<br>Child coroutine 2 throws an exception.
<br>Observations from the Example
<br>Child coroutine 2 fails with an exception, but this does not affect child coroutines `1` and `3`.
<br>Each child coroutine handles its exceptions independently.
The parent coroutine (the one that called supervisorScope) is not cancelled and continues to execute.

**Key Points**

SupervisorScope is useful when you want to isolate the failure of coroutines from each other.
<br>It allows for finer-grained control over exception handling and coroutine lifecycle.
<br>In a SupervisorScope, a child coroutine's failure does not cause the parent scope or other sibling coroutines to fail.
<br>By using SupervisorScope, you can create more robust and resilient applications where individual coroutines can fail and be handled without disrupting the entire coroutine hierarchy.

>how it is different from supervisor job?

SupervisorScope and SupervisorJob in Kotlin Coroutines both allow for similar behavior in terms of exception handling and coroutine supervision, but they differ in their usage and scope of application. Let's break down the differences:

#### SupervisorJob
**Definition**: <br>SupervisorJob is a type of Job that can be used as the parent job for a coroutine scope. It changes the default behavior of how exceptions are handled within the coroutines under its scope.

**Usage:** You use SupervisorJob when you create a new CoroutineScope. By passing a SupervisorJob to the scope, you ensure that the failure of one child coroutine does not lead to the immediate cancellation of all other coroutines within the same scope.

**Scope of Application:** SupervisorJob is more flexible in terms of its scope of application. You can use it to create a long-lived CoroutineScope that supervises coroutines over the entire lifecycle of an application or a particular component.

**Example:**
kotlin
Copy code
```
    val supervisor = SupervisorJob()
    val scope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default + supervisor)
    
    scope.launch {
        // Coroutine 1
        // ...
    }
    
    scope.launch {
        // Coroutine 2
        // ...
    }
```
In this example, the scope is a CoroutineScope with a SupervisorJob. Failures in either of the child coroutines do not affect each other.
#### SupervisorScope
**Definition:** <br>SupervisorScope is a function that creates a temporary supervisor scope for coroutines. It is used to define a specific block of code in which the coroutines are supervised.

**Usage:** You use SupervisorScope when you want to create a supervised section within your coroutine logic. It's often used for a specific part of your code where you want the supervisor behavior, rather than for the entire scope of a coroutine.

**Scope of Application:** SupervisorScope is generally used for a smaller, more focused part of the code, unlike SupervisorJob, which is more about structuring the overall behavior of a broader coroutine scope.

**Example:**
kotlin
Copy code
```
    CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default).launch {
        supervisorScope {
            launch {
                // Coroutine 1
                // ...
            }
    
            launch {
                // Coroutine 2
                // ...
            }
        }
    }
```
Here, the supervisorScope is used inside a launch block to create a supervised section.

**Key Differences**

**Level of Application:** SupervisorJob is applied at the CoroutineScope level and affects all coroutines launched within that scope. SupervisorScope is used for creating a supervised block within a coroutine.

**Flexibility:** SupervisorJob can be used to create a more permanent CoroutineScope with supervisory behavior, while SupervisorScope is ideal for temporary supervision within a specific block of code.

**Use Case:** Choose SupervisorJob for broader, application-wide or component-wide supervision. Use SupervisorScope for localized supervision within a specific part of your coroutine logic.
Both tools are powerful for managing coroutines in Kotlin, especially in complex applications where fine-grained control over coroutine behavior and exception handling is necessary.

> Can you tell more about SupervisorJob?

Certainly! SupervisorJob in Kotlin Coroutines is a concept used for exception handling and job supervision in a coroutine hierarchy. It's a type of Job that changes the default behavior of how coroutines within its scope handle exceptions. Understanding SupervisorJob is crucial for effectively managing coroutines, especially in complex applications where you need resilience and control over coroutine failures.

**Core Characteristics of SupervisorJob**

1. Exception Handling Behavior:

    In a standard coroutine job, if one child coroutine fails (throws an exception), it cancels its parent and all its sibling coroutines.
    With a SupervisorJob, the exception in a child coroutine does not lead to the cancellation of the parent job or other child coroutines. Each child coroutine is responsible for handling its exceptions.
2. Use in Coroutine Scopes:

    SupervisorJob is used to create a CoroutineScope where the coroutines operate independently in terms of failure. This is particularly useful when coroutines are performing distinct tasks that shouldn't affect each other.
3. Failure Isolation:

    It provides a way to isolate failures to the individual coroutines. This means that if one coroutine fails, it doesn't compromise the entire scope or other unrelated tasks.

**Example Use Case**
Let's look at a simple example to illustrate how SupervisorJob works:

kotlin
Copy code
```
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    val supervisor = SupervisorJob()
    val scope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default + supervisor)
    
        scope.launch {
            // This is a child coroutine
            println("Coroutine 1 is starting")
            delay(500)
            throw ArithmeticException("Something went wrong in Coroutine 1")
        }
    
        scope.launch {
            // Another child coroutine
            delay(1000)
            println("Coroutine 2 completed successfully")
        }
    
        delay(1500) // Wait for enough time for both coroutines to execute
        println("Back to main coroutine")
}
```
In this example:

We have two child coroutines within a CoroutineScope that uses SupervisorJob.
If the first coroutine throws an exception, it does not affect the second coroutine. The second coroutine completes its execution independently.
**Advantages of SupervisorJob**

**Resilience:** It makes your coroutine architecture more resilient, as a failure in one part doesn't bring down the entire system.

**Task Isolation:** Ideal for scenarios where coroutines have independent tasks and their failure should be handled individually.
Controlled Exception Handling: It allows for more controlled and granular exception handling within each coroutine.

**When to Use SupervisorJob?**
<br>In systems where various coroutines perform independent, unrelated tasks.
When you need to ensure that the failure of one operation (coroutine) does not disrupt others.
In UI applications where various UI updates or operations happen independently and failure in one should not affect the others.
Understanding and utilizing SupervisorJob is essential for effective concurrency management in Kotlin, particularly in applications requiring a high degree of fault tolerance and independent operation of concurrent tasks.

> How cancellation handled by SupervisorJob?

Cancellation in a SupervisorJob in Kotlin Coroutines behaves a bit differently compared to a regular Job. Understanding this behavior is crucial for effectively managing coroutines in scenarios where tasks are independent and should not necessarily impact each other upon cancellation or failure.

Key Points on Cancellation with SupervisorJob
1. Cancellation Propagation:

    In a regular Job, if a child coroutine is cancelled, it can lead to the cancellation of its parent and all its siblings.
    However, with a SupervisorJob, cancellation is not propagated from a child coroutine to its siblings or parent. If a child coroutine is cancelled, it doesn't automatically cancel the parent SupervisorJob or other child coroutines.
2. Independent Operation:

    SupervisorJob allows child coroutines to operate independently in terms of cancellation. This means that one coroutine's cancellation or failure doesn't impact the execution of other coroutines under the same SupervisorJob.
3. Explicit Cancellation:

    While child coroutines wonâ€™t cancel each other, you can still cancel the SupervisorJob itself, which would result in the cancellation of all its child coroutines. This is useful when you want to control the lifecycle of all coroutines collectively.

Example Illustrating Cancellation Behavior
kotlin
Copy code
```
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
val supervisor = SupervisorJob()
val scope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default + supervisor)

    val child1 = scope.launch {
        println("Coroutine 1 is starting")
        delay(1000)
        println("Coroutine 1 is completing normally")
    }

    val child2 = scope.launch {
        println("Coroutine 2 is starting")
        delay(200) // shorter delay
        println("Coroutine 2 is cancelling")
        cancel("Intentional cancellation") // Cancelling this coroutine
    }

    joinAll(child1, child2) // Wait for both child coroutines
    println("Back to main coroutine")
}
```
In this example:

`child2` coroutine is explicitly cancelled.
<br>Despite the cancellation of `child2`, `child1` continues its execution and completes normally.

**Implications for Design**

**Task Isolation:** Use SupervisorJob when you need tasks (coroutines) to run independently, ensuring that the failure or cancellation of one does not affect others.

**Controlled Lifecycle Management:** It allows for a more nuanced management of coroutines, where you have the flexibility to cancel individual tasks without disrupting the entire set of tasks.

**Use in Complex Systems:** Especially useful in complex systems where various components operate concurrently and independently, such as in UI applications or network operations.
In summary, SupervisorJob provides a way to isolate cancellation and failure among coroutines, ensuring that one coroutine's behavior doesn't automatically dictate the behavior of others in its scope. This can lead to more resilient and fault-tolerant applications, particularly where individual tasks need to be managed independently.

> How to cancel a launch Coroutines?

Cancelling a coroutine started with launch in Kotlin is straightforward and an integral part of Kotlin's coroutines design, allowing for cooperative and graceful cancellation of running tasks. Here's how you can do it:

**Steps to Cancel a launch Coroutine**
<br>Create and Keep a Reference to the Job:
<br>When you start a coroutine using launch, it returns a Job object. You need to keep a reference to this Job.
<br>Call cancel on the Job:
To cancel the coroutine, simply call the cancel method on the stored Job reference.
Making Coroutine Cancellation Cooperative:
Coroutines are cooperatively cancellable. It means they check for cancellation and exit gracefully at specific points. Inbuilt suspending functions like delay and yield are cancellation points.
If your coroutine is doing computation or running a loop, you should check for cancellation status within the coroutine, using isActive (a property of the coroutine's context), or manually throw CancellationException.
**Example**
Here's a simple example illustrating coroutine cancellation:

kotlin
Copy code

```
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    val job = launch {
        repeat(1000) { i ->
            // Check if coroutine is still active (not cancelled)
            if (isActive) {
                println("job: I'm sleeping $i ...")
                delay(500L)
            }
        }
    }

    delay(1300L) // delay a bit
    println("main: I'm tired of waiting!")
    job.cancel() // cancels the job
    job.join() // waits for job's completion
    println("main: Now I can quit.")
}
```
In this example:

A coroutine is launched, which repeats a task (with delay in each iteration).
After a certain delay, the main coroutine decides to cancel the job.
The `cancel()` function is called on the job, and then `join()` is used to wait until the coroutine has completed its cancellation process.
The coroutine checks for cancellation using isActive.

**Key Points**

**Cooperative Cancellation:** Kotlin's coroutine cancellation is cooperative. A coroutine must cooperate to be cancellable.

**Cancellation Points:** Use inbuilt suspending functions like delay or yield, or check isActive for custom cancellation points.

**Graceful Termination:** After cancellation, use `join()` if you need to wait for the coroutine to finish its cleanup and terminate gracefully.
By following these steps, you can effectively cancel coroutines in Kotlin, ensuring that your application can handle asynchronous tasks in a controlled and predictable manner.


> How about async?

Cancelling an async coroutine in Kotlin is similar to cancelling a launch coroutine, but with some key differences related to the Deferred object that async returns. Here's how to handle cancellation in async coroutines:

**Steps to Cancel an async Coroutine**

<br>Create and Keep a Reference to the Deferred Object:
<br>When you start a coroutine using async, it returns a Deferred object, which is a future-like object representing the eventual outcome of the coroutine.
<br>Keep a reference to this Deferred object.
<br>Call cancel on the Deferred Object:
<br>To cancel the coroutine, call the cancel method on the Deferred object.
<br>Handle Cancellation within the Coroutine:
<br>Similar to launch, async coroutines need to be cooperative for cancellation to work effectively.
<br>Use suspension points like delay, check for isActive, or handle CancellationException within the coroutine.

**Example**
Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating how to cancel an async coroutine:

kotlin
Copy code
```
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    val deferred = async {
        repeat(1000) { i ->
            // Check if coroutine is still active (not cancelled)
            if (isActive) {
                println("async: I'm working on $i ...")
                delay(500L)
            }
        }
        "Result" // This result will never be produced in this example
    }

    delay(1300L) // delay a bit
    println("main: I'm tired of waiting!")
    deferred.cancel() // cancels the coroutine
    try {
        deferred.await() // will throw CancellationException
    } catch (e: CancellationException) {
        println("main: Coroutine was cancelled")
    }
}
```
In this example:

An async coroutine is started and returns a Deferred object.
After some delay, the Deferred object is cancelled.
`await()` on Deferred after cancellation will throw a `CancellationException`.

**Key Points for async**

**Deferred Outcome:** Since async is designed to return a result, handling the outcome after cancellation is important. The await() function will throw a CancellationException if the coroutine is cancelled.

**Cooperative Cancellation:** Ensure your async coroutine is cooperative by using suspension functions or checking isActive.

**Exception Handling:** Be prepared to handle CancellationException when you call await() on a cancelled Deferred.
